## Who am I ?
I am a versatile professional with a solid background in education and fitness coaching, currently working as a web developer. I bring a diverse range of interests and experiences to my work, infusing each project with a unique blend of creativity and practicality.

My love for learning is at the heart of everything I do, and I am constantly seeking out new skills and technologies to add to my toolkit. Whether it's exploring the latest programming languages or delving into the latest fitness trends, I approach each new challenge with enthusiasm and a hunger for knowledge.

## What am I doing now ?
- Fitness and Running: I developed a personalized web application that includes a range of healthy calculators, fitness tests, and training plan guides. My goal is to help people achieve their fitness goals by providing them with the resources and knowledge they need to create a sustainable workout routine.
- We-Talk.com: As a web developer, I had the opportunity to work on an innovative communication platform designed for non-verbal individuals. This web application facilitates full conversations by offering a variety of features that allow users to express themselves in unique ways.
- Book Sharing: I created a website that enables book enthusiasts from all over the world to share their own bookshelves and exchange books with each other. This platform encourages a love of reading and fosters a sense of community among book lovers.
